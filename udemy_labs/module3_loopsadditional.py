# We already know the most important elements of loops in python, but there are also a few other additional featuures
# There is a special instruction in python which doesn't do anything named pass
# We use pass because loop syntax requires at least one instruction inside the loops body
# You may be in the middle of writing your code and you don't know yet what to put inside your loops body so you may start off with a pass instruction so that your code doesnt throw errors
# The same applies to if, elif, & else statement blocks and you may use the pass instruction to that end
# Next just like with nested if statments, you can use nested loops
# Loops with else statments are rarely used in practice 
# Both loop types for and while can have and additional else clause after the body
# Watch out because the keyword else can be very misleading here
# Remeber the else branch of a loop is always excecuted exactly once (exception: break statement)
