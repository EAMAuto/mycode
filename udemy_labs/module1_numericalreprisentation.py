#There are two main numerical types integers and floats 

#INTEGERS being represented as numbers without quoatations 
#FLOATS being represented as numbers which include a decimal also without quotations

# Now beginning in python3.6 you can use Underscores in numbers (_) this does not change the value of the number just the readability

#for example 12000300 vs 12_000_300 are both equal

#when working with floats a scientific notation can be used when using very big or very small numbers to avoid writing too many zero's

# for example 
#3e4 = 3E4 - 3 *10000 = 30000
#3e-4 = 3E-4 = 3 *1/10000= 0.0003

# when you use the print function python will automatically use the scientific notation
# for example the output of print(0.000000000000000000000000003) would be 3e-27(roughly, I didnt count the 0 but you get the point)

# finally integer numbers can be represented in 2 other ways as octal #'s and as hexidecimal numbers

# Octal #'s 
# start with 0O or 0o the number is an octal value
# the #'s that follow this type of prefic must from the range 0-7 only, digits 8 & 9 are not allowed
# for example print(0o123) == 83 in standard decimal notation

# Hexadecimal numbers 
# start with 0X or 0x
#for example print(0x123) = 291 in the standard decimal notation

#octal and hexadecimal #'s are rarely used in high level programming simply remember that octal #'s start with 0o or 0O and hexadecimal #'s begin with 0X or 0x
