#intput() is a function which asks the user for a value and gives you back the value that the user has provided
#for example
#print("what is your name?')
#user_name = input()
#print('hello', user_name)

# the result of the above code is for python to ask the suer there name and the user to input there name and for python to return the statement "hello, user_name"

#REMEMBER 
#functions in python can:
# 1. Cause some effect
# 2. Return a value

# the input function can be nested within the variable being asked for along with the question statment by doing the following
# user_name = input('What is your name?")
#pring('Hello, user_name')

# The input function by default always returns a string value even if the user enters a number which can present a problem because python cannot perform mathematical calculations on strings
