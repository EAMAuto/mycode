#python has different variable types same as excel
greeting = 'Hello, friend!' # This variable contains a string data type and we know this because quotes are present

age = 35 # This is an integer data type and seen as such because there are no quotes around 35

age = '35' # note that this is a string data type because the numbers are surrounded by quotes

speed1 = 4.5 #This is data type is reffered to as a float
speed2 = 4.0 #This is also considered a float
speed3 = 4 #although this is equal to speed2 mathematicaly the data type is considered an integer


# a Boolean data type is always equal to either True or False *note the capital letter*

am_i_ugly = True #This is a boolean data type
am_i_ugly = true #This is NOT a boolean data type

# THE GOLDEN RULE#
#WHEN IT COMES TO BOOLEAN VALUE VALUES ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT BY CONVENTION  True = 1,False = 0
