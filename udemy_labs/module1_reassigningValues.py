# you can use two operators + * with strings 
# The + operator is used to join two strings together and this is reffered to as string concatination which is joining strings
# for example text = 'hokus' + 'pokus'
# print(text) will be hokuspokus

#you can also multiply a string by an integer in python 
#print('hokus' * 5) will be hokushokushokushokushokus

# you can also perform mathematical operations within the print command
# print(23+5) = 28
# but numbers with quoatations will be treated as strings and thus either multiplied in amount and not in value or string concatenated as shown below 
#print('23' + '5") = 235( string concatination)
#print ('23' * 3) = 232323 (string multiplication)
